# Basic Concepts

the goal of linear algebra computation is try to solve a linear system

$$
{ x }_{ 1 }+{ 2x }_{ 2 }+{ 2x }_{ 3 }+{ 2x }_{ 4 }={ b }_{ 1 }\\ { 2x }_{ 1 }+{ 4x }_{ 2 }+{ 6x }_{ 3 }+{ 8x }_{ 4 }={ b }_{ 2 }\\ { 3x }_{ 1 }+{ 6x }_{ 2 }+{ 8x }_{ 3 }+{ 10x }_{ 4 }={ b }_{ 3 }
$$

and the naive way is to use elimination and back substitution.

# Way to solve the linear system

1. Dimension Reduction (Approximation)
2. Factorization
